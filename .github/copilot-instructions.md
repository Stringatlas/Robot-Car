Please follow these rules when generating code:
- Do not use emojis.  
- Avoid unnecessary comments — only add comments when the code’s intent or logic is non-obvious.  
- Keep output concise and to the point.  
- Do not generate extra markdown files for explanations.
- Focus on code quality and best practices. Avoid bulky files and adhere to modularity and SOLID principles.
